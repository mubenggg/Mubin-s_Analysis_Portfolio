## ðŸ§  Project Background

As the sole data analyst at Pasadana SDN BHD, a company focused on debt recovery and customer service, I was tasked with designing a centralized and interactive dashboard to monitor and evaluate collection performance over multiple years. Our operations span across various sectors such as Banking, Education, Telco, Corporate, and Consumer.

The primary goal was to give upper management and operations teams a clear, real-time snapshot of total collections, sector-wise contributions, product performance, and collection trends to aid strategic decisions and improve client servicing.



### Key Features

- Interactive filtering by Year and Sector for granular analysis.
- Real-time visibility of performance from both client and product perspectives.
- Easy identification of collection peaks and dips throughout the months.
- Supports strategic planning, performance benchmarking, and operational improvements.


## ðŸ’¼ Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings
Between January 2023 and March 2025, the companyâ€™s monthly collections demonstrated varied performance across key sectors, including Banking, Education, Telco, and Others. Following a period of steady decline in mid-2023, there was a notable surge in collection performance in Q2 and Q3 of 2024, peaking in August 2024 with RM9.3M in total collections â€” the highest in the period analyzed.

Key statistical analysis revealed a high variance in monthly collection values, indicating inconsistent collection patterns across months. While the Banking sector consistently contributed the highest amount, sharp increases from the Education sector in 2024 significantly boosted overall performance.

However, since October 2024, collections have shown a declining trend, with March 2025 closing at RM5.2M, a 44% drop from the August 2024 peak. This downward trend indicates a need for renewed focus on recovery efforts and sector-specific strategy alignment.

The following insights have been derived from the interactive Power BI dashboard:

- Highest monthly collection: RM9.3M (August 2024)
- Lowest monthly collection: RM4.4M (April 2023)
- Total Collection (2023 â€“ March 2025): Approx. RM159M+
- Major contributors: Banking, followed by Education in recent months
- Statistical Spread (Variance): High â€” suggesting potential opportunities for process standardization or targeting key high-performing months/sectors

This dashboard provides a foundational tool for operational planning, performance review, and executive decision-making, helping teams to identify both peak performance periods and underperforming segments.
